This assignment was completed in close coordination with Victor Ramirez and Shea Fitzgerald, with supplementary talks with Mike Richardson and Ben Salis. Liam Kelley worked individually through most of the preliminary parts of the assignment unil the begining of the "Data Exploration" section of the notebook. From there, L.K. and V.R. worked with S.F. on generating the histograms for that section. The data analysis algortihm was primarily written by S.F. with small adjustments by L.K. to make the code work. From there, V.R. and S.F. generated the replicated figure. L.K. generated the table on his own.
