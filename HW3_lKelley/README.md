For this homework assignment, I worked in a group with Victor Ramirez, Shea Fitzgerald, Ben Salis, and Mike Richardson

Since the majority of this homework was rather linear, we worked simultaneously while asking each other questions about the process as it occurred.
I was able to complete most of the manipulation of the data into acceptable forms by myself, but the actual analysis became more of a collaborative effort.
