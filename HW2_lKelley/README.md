For this homework, I generally did not work in a group. Victor Ramirez and I collaborated a little in the beginning of the assignment with understanding just generally how the code for both homework notebooks operated. Other than that, I answered all questions in the first notebook on my own accord and generated all figures for the second homework. This includes the captions for the figures and the analysis at the end.

I plan to work in a larger group with more connection for all subsequent homework assignments.
