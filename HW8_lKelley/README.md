Here is my created figure for this homework:

Caption: This figure shows the distribution of a few metrics of offenses in the National Football League. Teams are plotted comparing
their average points per game and average yards per game, also comparing to the two year average for the league. If this graph was a part
of a larger paper, analysis could be done on this data to understand if rule changes between the 2016 and 2017 seasons had any effect on
offense performances in the following year. This graph does not look at the performance of individual teams. Rather, it shows the whole 
distribution of teams throughout the league. Through this graph, one could begin to understand the general trends about how offenses perform
in the league.
