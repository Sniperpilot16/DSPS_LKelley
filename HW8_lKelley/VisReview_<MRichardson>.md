CLARITY:  This graph is very easy to read. The legend is clearly out of the way; obstruction is not an issue. Additionally, your 
          axis ranges are fitting (no pun intended) for the data presented. The only thing I would be worried about it putting 
          this into black and white and it still being able to be read well. In that instance all of the points would blend in 
          together in a blob of grey. Although it is not a big issue, the dashed line and then the dash-doted line at a quick glance
          seem to look relatively the same. However, since they both represnent averages of each axis, it is clear enough. Well done. 
AESTHETIC:Similar to what I said above, some of the colors could get washed into each other given the instance of greyscale. However, 
          Each of the other elements present within the graph are fitting for the message you are trying to convey. Additionally, 
          I am glad that you did not add a line fit to the data even though you could argue that there is a linear correlation 
          between the average points per game and the average yards per game, it would have caused there to be too many elements on 
          the page. Very well done. 
HONESTY:  Although you changed the bounds on each axis, and that seems to be the right way to convey the message you are sending, 
          is that not necessarily the right move? Having background knowledge on point totals in the NFL, the amount of points 
          are much harder to get than yards. Is this bounding obscuring the data however to make it appear to be an x=y linear 
          fit?
SUGGESTIONS:
          1. Change one of the sets of teams (i.e. the 2017 Teams) to a different shape per point. Given this it will nearly complete
              your greyscale figure 
          2. Your 'Two-Year League Average Yards/Game' and 'Two-Year League Average Points/Game' line patterns seem to close to 
              each other. Consider two lines that are more diverse. 
          3. Consider adding a description of the statistical importance of the intersection of the average yards/game and points/game
              lines. 
              
          OVERALL GREAT FIGURE.
